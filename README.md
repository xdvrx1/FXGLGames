This repo contains sample games built with <a href="https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL">FXGL</a> Game Library.
Each game focuses on one or two aspects of FXGL, e.g. Drop focuses on bare minimums, Pac-man focuses on AI, etc.

Checkout [this commit](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGLGames/commit/a0821c76ba4a7a64dba4f9ec6f182827d909561c) for Java 8 code for all projects (FXGL 0.5.4).
All projects will eventually be upgraded to Java 11 code (FXGL 11.0+).

## Build
```bash
cd PROJECT_NAME
mvn package
```
This will produce a standalone executable with that project in <code>target/</code>.
Most games are pre-built and can be downloaded from [binaries](binaries).

## Run
```bash
cd target/
java -jar PROJECT_NAME-VERSION.jar
```
OR simply double-click the jar file if the extensions are correctly set on your machine.
